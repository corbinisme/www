All evildoers Thou dost hate, cut off shall liars be; The bloody and deceitful man abhorred is by Thee.</li><li>But I into Thy house will come in Thy abundant grace; And I will worship in Thy fear toward Thy holy place. Because of watch ful enemies, O lead me by Thy grace, And in Thy righteousness, Thy way make straight before my face.</li><li> Let all who trust in Thee be glad, in shouts their praise proclaim; Thou savest them; let all rejoice who love Thy holy name.

From heaven\'s end its rising is, Its circuit to its ends; And there is nothing from its heat, No, nothing is hidden thereof.</li><li>The law of God is a perfect law, For it converts the soul; Sure are the sayings of our God, They make the simple wise.

But the Eternal\'s face is against those who are evil, doers of wrong; He cuts remembrance off from them, cuts their remembrance from the earth.</li><li> When righteous men cry, God always hears, for He delivers them from fears. Near unto them of a broken heart, contrite of spirit, God saveth them. Many afflictions that we do have, troubles there be of righteous men; But the Eternal delivereth out from afflictions the righteous man.</li><li>Turn thou from evil, do what is good; seek peace, pursue it earnestly.

Kingdoms moved, the nations raged, and the earth melted at His Word; The Lord of hosts for us engaged, our refuge high is Jacob\'s God.</li><li> A river flows, whose living streams gladden the city of our God; Tents where heavenly glory beams, where the Lord has His abode. God has Zion His dwelling made; she shall nevermore be moved; Her God shall early give His aid; He her help has ever proved.</li><li>Come, see the works of God displayed, wonders of His mighty hand; Desolations He has made, ruins spread through all the land. \"Be still, know I am God Most High; o\'er the nations I will reign.\" The Lord of hosts to us is nigh; Jacob\'s God our help remains. </li></ol>",
hymn029: "<h1> 29 Mount Zion Stands Most Beautiful</h1> <ol><li> The Lord Eternal is most great and greatly to be praised! Within the city of our God, upon His holy hill. Mount Zion stands most beautiful, the joy of all the land! The city of the mighty King doth on her north side stand.</li><li> Within her palaces our God is for a refuge known; For lo, the kings assembled, together they did come. When they beheld it all amazed, they fled in great dismay; And being troubled at Thy sight, they thence did haste away.</li><li>As we have heard, we saw within the city of our God, The city which the Lord of hosts established evermore. We of Thy loving-kindness thought, in Thy most holy place; O God, according to Thy name, Thy praise fills all the earth! </li></ol>",

The fowls are all to Me well-known, that mountains high do yield; I also claim as all My own the wild beasts of the field.</li><li> Sing joyful songs to God Most High; give thanks and offer praise; And when the day of trouble comes, I\'ll hear and answer you. Think you that I would eat of flesh, or ask for sacrifice? But rather unto Me, your God, give thanks and offer praise.</li><li>But to the wicked man God says, \"Why mention My commands? Why take My cov\'nant on your lips, and cast My words behind?\" He glorifies My name who brings the sacrifice of praise: I\'ll show salvation unto him who orders right his ways. </li></ol>",
hymn031: "<h1> 31 In Thy Lovingkindness, Lord</h1> <ol><li> In Thy lovingkindness, Lord, be merciful to me; In compassion great blot out all iniquity. Wash me thoroughly from sin, from all guilt cleanse Thou me; For transgressions I confess; sins I ever see.</li><li> Gainst Thee only have I sinned, done evil in Thy sight, That Thou speaking may be just, and in judging right. My iniquities blot out, my sin hide from Thy view, And in me a clean heart make, spirit right renew.</li><li>From Thy gracious presence, Lord, O cast me not away, And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me I pray. Joy which Thy salvation brings again to me restore; With Thy Spirit free do Thou keep me evermore.</li><li> Sacrifice dost Thou not want, else would I give it Thee, And with offering shalt Thou not delighted be.

For they that strangers are to me, do up against me rise; Oppressors who care not for God but seek to take my life.</li><li> The mighty God my Helper is; lo, therefore I am bold. He taketh part with ev\'ry one, that doth my soul uphold. To all my watchful foes He will their evil deeds repay; O for Thy truth\'s sake cut them off and take them all away.</li><li>A freewill off\'ring I to Thee will bring in sacrifice. Lord, of Thy name, for it is good; Thy praises will I sing. Because He hath delivered me from all adversities; And His desire mine eye hath seen, upon mine enemies. </li></ol>",
hymn033: "<h1> 33 But As for Me. I\'ll Call On God</h1> <ol><li> Twas not a foe who did deride, for that I could endure; No hater thus who rose in pride, else would I hide secure. But thou it was my friend and guide; we did as equals meet; We walked to God\'s house side by side, and counsel blended sweet.</li><li> His speech more smooth than butter was, yet in his heart was war; More soft than oil his words appear, yet sharp as drawn swords were they. But Lord Thou will in judgment sit and bring them down to woe; And in the deep and darksome pit, in ruin lay them low.</li><li>Death shall them seize, and to the tomb, alive they shall go down; For wickedness is in their home; among them abound their sins.

Let God prolong the true king\'s life; forever let Him reign! That He may sit before our God, enthroned in righteousness.</li><li>When I was faint I cried to God, and He did hear my prayer; For He has been my dwelling place; a shelter from the foe.

How long will men take pleasure in sin? They plot and threaten the life of the king.</li><li> Vain men are they, delighting in craft; Their lips they bless with, but they curse inwardly; Low men or high, both are less than a breath; Trust and rely not on extortion and gain. Rescue shall come from my God alone, And I shall never be greatly removed.</li><li>Still, O my soul, wait in silence for God; My hope and refuge is in my God alone; He is my Rock, my salvation and strength; With God alone shall my deliverance be.

Say now to God, \"How dread Your works, how awesome are Your deeds! So great Your pow\'r Your foes submit, all the earth worships You!\"</li><li> O come, and see His great works, among men how dread His deeds!

Give unto Him your grateful thanks who has kept us safe in life; And not allowed our feet to slip, tho' You have tested us, Tho' we were captured by our foes; yet have You set us free.</li><li> So will I come before my God, I will pay my vows to Him; Vows which my lips have spoken, which I promised when distress\'d. All you who fear Him, come and hear, come you who worship Him; I will declare what God has done, what He has done for me!</li><li> I called to God and cried out, I extolled Him with high praise; Had I of sin been thinking, surely God would never hear. But God indeed has heard my pray\'r; blessed be God who hears; He has not checked my pray\'r to Him, nor His own love to me. </li></ol>",

Man\'s mounted foes of faithless fear and godless enmity Like horse and rider, long ago, He\'ll bury in the sea. We will sing unto the Lord for He will triumph gloriously, He\'ll install a godly kingdom built to last eternally. </li></ol>",
