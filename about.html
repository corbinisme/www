  <h1>Hymnal</h1>
<p> <em><strong>Praise  the  LORD!  For  it  is  good  to  sing  praises  to  our  God; for  it  is  pleasant,  and  praise  is  beautiful. - Psalm  147:1</strong></em></p>
<p>Singing  has  been  an  integral  part  of  godly  worship  through  the ages—from the angels singing at the creation of the earth (Job 38:7), to  the  children  of  Israel  singing  praise  to God  for  deliverance  from the  Egyptian  army  (Exodus  15),  to  brethren  in  the New  Testament 
  being  instructed  to  sing  and  make  melody  to  God  in  their  hearts 
(Ephesians 5:19). God wants us to delight in singing His praises.</p>
<p> The book of Revelation reveals singing will continue to be a vital part 
  of worship in the coming Kingdom of God. Revelation 14:3 and 15:3 
  describe the saints singing a new song, as well as the song of Moses 
  and the song of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Today  this  tradition  of  singing  continues  as  we  fulfill  God’s 
  instruction  by  devoting  a  significant  portion  of  our  services  to 
  collectively  sing  praise  to  Him.  Inspiring  lyrics  remind  us  of  the 
  magnificent truths of His Word. Through singing hymns we have an 
  opportunity  to  musically  express  our  deepest  emotions  of  grateful 
  appreciation  to  God  for  His  plan  of  salvation  for  us  and  all  of 
  humanity.  Because  of  the  magnitude  of  His  wonderful  work  and 
  incredible  love,  God  deserves  our  deepest  love,  honor  and  respect 
  through praise.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 instructs us to sing “psalms and hymns and spiritual 
  songs” to God with thankful hearts. As you will note in the table of 
  contents, this hymnal has been organized with this scripture in mind. 
May we use this hymnal to fulfill God’s instruction: “I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation&quot; (Psalm 111:1) and &quot;I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sings praise to my God while I have my being&quot; (Psalm 104:33).</p>
